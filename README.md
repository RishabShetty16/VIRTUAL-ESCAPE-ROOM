# VIRTUAL-ESCAPE-ROOM
Virtual Escape Room
A thrilling, web-based virtual escape room game where players must solve riddles to find their way out of a haunted college basement. This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an atmospheric and interactive experience.

Game Story
It was the night of the full moon, and campus lay cloaked in shadows, silent but for the rustling leaves and the occasional distant howl of a stray dog. A daring PES student, lured by tales of hidden passageways and forgotten rooms, decided it would be the perfect night to explore the legendary basement beneath the college. Supposedly, strange things had been reported over the years—a maze of rooms that shifted, doors that locked themselves, and whispers echoing in the dark.
The basement was colder than he’d expected, the light flickering as he took the first steps down the creaking stairs. But when he turned to head back up, the door was gone. A strange feeling settled over him as he moved from room to room, each door presenting a challenge—a question etched onto an ancient plaque.
With every correct answer, the next room would open. But with every wrong answer, the basement seemed to grow darker, colder, and he would find himself right back where he started, disoriented and beginning again.
Would he make it through all the doors before morning light, or would he be trapped in the college's haunted basement maze forever? Only the right answers would lead him to freedom.

How to Play
The rules of the escape room are simple but challenging:

Goal: Escape the basement by correctly answering a series of questions hidden in different rooms.
Starting the Game: The game begins with a choice of three doors, each leading to a unique room and a different question.
Answering Questions: To progress, you must correctly answer the riddle presented in each room. A right answer unlocks the next stage.
Lives: You have two attempts to answer each question. If you fail both attempts, you are sent back to the very first room to start over.
Winning: Successfully answer all the questions in your path without being sent back to escape the basement and win the game.

Features
User Authentication: A simple login and signup system to track players.
Interactive Gameplay: Players navigate the game by choosing doors and submitting answers.
Atmospheric Design: The game uses spooky fonts ('Nosifer'), dark themes, overlays, and background images to create an immersive horror experience.
Riddle-Based Puzzles: The core challenge involves solving riddles like "What comes once in a minute, twice in a moment, but never in a thousand years?"
Dynamic Feedback: The interface provides immediate feedback, telling the player if their answer is correct, if they have one attempt left, or if they are being sent back.

Technologies Used
This project was built entirely with front-end web technologies:

HTML5: Structures the content of the game pages.
CSS3: Handles all styling, layout, fonts, and animations.
JavaScript (Vanilla): Powers all the game logic, including answer checking, attempt tracking, and navigation.
